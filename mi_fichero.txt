Once upon a time, the Sky was friendly and very close to people.
It provided everything people needed for free.
Then people when they were hungry, they didn't go to a restaurant but they didn´t go home either. They just cut off small piece of the sky and ate it.
So often some people cut off bigger piece they really needed. And the Sky did its recommendations: Please cut off piece of food you really need and avoid sheding food in the rubbish. In short term people respected those advises. But later in long term, they forgot what the Sky recommended to them. So they restarted to waste a huge amount of food. One of the mmost remarkable case was that of a very greedy woman that came ant cut off bigger and bigger piece of the sky. She couldn´t finish it, her and her husband together. The called all the children in the village. All together couldn´t finish it either. They went and search more folks elswhere around the village. But still they couldn´t eat all that piece of food cut off from the sky. Finally they went and throw the rest to the rubbish.
The Sky became angrier angrier. It shouted too loud and went far away above to the earth.
Today when we are hungry we have to do it ourselves.
